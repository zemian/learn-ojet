# Learning Oracle JET

This project is for exploring [Oracle JET](https://oraclejet.org) framework. 

The initial files are generated using `npx '@oracle/ojet-cli' create learn-ojet` with a blank template.

## Quick static files testing

Instead of loading and running the full OJET application, we can quickly test OJET UI component using static html file. See `static/hello.html` for example.

NOTE: These static file assume you have run `ojet build` once that generated the `web` folder to access the OJET css and js lib files.
